Hereâ€™s the updated `README.md` file for your OCR script, addressing issues with GUI support on Termux and providing clearer instructions for modifying the script for use on Android via Termux.

# OCR Script Using Tesseract in Termux

This Python script utilizes the Tesseract OCR engine to extract text from images. It is designed to run on Termux, an Android terminal emulator, and leverages the Tkinter GUI for file selection (which requires modification for Termux compatibility). The script saves the extracted text into a `.txt` file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Termux installed on your Android device. You can install Termux from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).

### Step 1: Install Termux

- Install Termux from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux/).

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open Termux and run the following commands to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install python
pkg install tesseract
pkg install clang
pkg install tk
pkg install libjpeg-turbo
pkg install libpng
```

This will install:

- `python`: To run the Python script.
- `tesseract`: The OCR engine for text extraction.
- `clang`, `tk`, `libjpeg-turbo`, `libpng`: Dependencies for Tkinter and image processing.

### Step 3: Install Python Libraries

After installing the required packages, install the necessary Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pillow pytesseract
```

- `Pillow`: Python Imaging Library for opening and processing image files.
- `pytesseract`: Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR.

## Script Setup

### Step 1: Save the Script

Save the Python script (`ocr-tmux.py`) in a directory of your choice.

### Step 2: Modify Tesseract Path

Ensure that the Tesseract executable path is correctly set in the script:

```python
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/tesseract'
```

This is the path where Tesseract is installed in Termux. Make sure this is the correct path.

### Step 3: Modify Script for Termux Compatibility

Since Termux does not support GUI applications like Tkinter's file dialog, you need to manually provide the file path or modify the script to accept it via command-line arguments.

Modify the script as follows to accept the image file path from the command line:

```python
import sys
file_path = sys.argv[1]  # Get the image file path from the command-line argument
```

If the script originally used Tkinter for file selection, replace that part with the above code to allow the user to input the image file path as a command-line argument.

### Step 4: Running the Script

Once the script is set up, run it by passing the image file path as a command-line argument:

```bash
python ocr-tmux.py /path/to/your/image.jpg
```

### Output

The script will process the provided image, extract the text, and save the extracted text into a file named `output.txt` in the current working directory.

```bash
Text has been saved to output.txt
```

## Notes

- **Tkinter GUI**: The Tkinter `askopenfilename` dialog does not work in Termux as it requires a GUI environment. You will need to provide the image file path manually or modify the script to allow for input in another way (e.g., using command-line arguments).
- **File Output**: The extracted text is saved to `output.txt` in the directory where the script is run.
- **Termux Filesystem**: Make sure to upload the image files to the appropriate Termux directory or provide their absolute path.

## Conclusion

This script allows you to extract text from images using Tesseract OCR on Termux. The script saves the extracted text in a `.txt` file, making it easy to process or store the information.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your needs, and contribute to the project if you'd like to add more features!

### Key Changes:
1. **Command-line arguments**: Since Termux doesn't support the Tkinter file dialog, I suggested using command-line arguments to pass the image file path.
2. **Tesseract path**: The path to the Tesseract executable is explicitly set for Termux.
3. **Clarification**: Instructions and modifications for Termux compatibility have been emphasized.

Let me know if any further adjustments are needed!
